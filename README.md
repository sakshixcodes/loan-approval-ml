# 💰 Loan Approval Prediction using Machine Learning

This ML project predicts whether a loan application should be approved based on applicant details like income, credit history, employment status, and more. Ideal for fintech and bank automation solutions.

## 🚀 Features

- Predicts loan approval (Yes/No)
- Handles missing values and categorical encoding
- Trained and tested on cleaned loan datasets
- Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, or Random Forest used
- UI built with Streamlit (optional)

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit / Flask (for UI)
- Jupyter Notebook
